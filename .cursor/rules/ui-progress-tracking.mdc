# UI Progress Tracking Guidelines

## Progress Indicators

### Status Tracking
- Always use state variables to track processing status
- Update UI in real-time with processing progress
- Show clear indicators for each processing stage
- Provide visual feedback during long-running operations

### Batch Processing
- Track both individual item progress and overall batch progress
- Use `useEffect` hooks to update batch progress based on current item and total count
- Avoid direct progress updates within processing loops
- Calculate overall progress as: `(currentIndex / totalItems) * 100 + currentItemProgress / totalItems`

### Progress Bar Components
- Show detailed step information alongside progress bars
- Use color coding for different status types (processing, success, error)
- Include both percentage and step indicators
- Ensure smooth transitions between progress states

## Status Messaging

### Log Entries
- Include timestamps in all log messages
- Use different styling for different message types (info, success, error)
- Show detailed error information when operations fail
- Provide actionable context in error messages

### Modal Dialogs
- Keep users informed with modal header information
- Show clear action buttons based on current processing state
- Disable actions during processing
- Provide cancel options for long-running operations

## Example Implementation

```tsx
// Track both overall progress and current item progress
const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
const [batchProgress, setBatchProgress] = useState(0);
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

// Update overall progress based on current item progress
useEffect(() => {
  if (isProcessing && totalItems > 0) {
    const overallProgress = 
      (currentIndex / totalItems) * 100 + progress / totalItems;
    setBatchProgress(Math.min(overallProgress, 100));
  }
}, [progress, currentIndex, totalItems, isProcessing]);
```
